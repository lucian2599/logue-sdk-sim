# logue-sdk-sim
Original source is at https://www.dtmstation.com/contents/logue-sdk-sim/ .
I put it here in order to try any future custom oscillators.
Currently I'm stucked because I need to learn about wasm, but while I get into this and then code oscillators according to [Korg Logue SDK](https://korginc.github.io/logue-sdk/), then ... I'm airborne! :-)

You can try this copy [here online](http://lucian2599.github.io/logue-sdk-sim/) .
Or you can try it offline by downloading/cloning the entire repository on your PC/laptop, then run simplewebserver.pl in perl, 
then open in Chrome the page http://localhost:8080 . You need to install perl, for e.g. I use http://strawberryperl.com/ .
